\begin_layout Part
The Internet of Things and Arduino.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Internet of Things (IOT).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the 
\emph on
network of physical objects
\emph default
 - devices, vehicles, buildings and other items - 
\emph on
embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that
 enables these objects to collect and exchange data
\emph default
.
 The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely
 across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more
 direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and
 resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\emph on
IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators
\emph default
, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of 
\emph on
cyber-physical systems
\emph default
, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart homes,
 intelligent transportation and smart cities.
 Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system
 but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton first coined the term in 1999 while working
 at Auto-ID Labs (originally called Auto-ID centers, referring to a global
 network of objects connected to radio-frequency identification, or RFID).
 Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems,
 and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and
 covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.
 The interconnection of these embedded devices (including smart objects),
 is expected to usher in automation in nearly all fields, while also enabling
 advanced applications like a Smart Grid, and expanding to the areas such
 as smart cities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's review some of the more important application fields of IOT:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Electrical Power Networks (Smart Grids).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
\emph on
smart grid
\series default
\emph default
 is an electrical grid which includes a variety of operational and energy
 measures including smart meters, smart appliances, renewable energy resources,
 and energy efficiency resources.
 Electronic power conditioning and control of the production and distribution
 of electricity are important aspects of the smart grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smart grid policy is organized in Europe as Smart Grid European Technology
 Platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Roll-out of smart grid technology also implies a fundamental re-engineering
 of the electricity services industry, although typical usage of the term
 is focused on the technical infrastructure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the early 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{21{}^{st}}$
\end_inset

 century, opportunities to take advantage of improvements in electronic
 communication technology to resolve the limitations and costs of the electrical
 grid have become apparent.
 Technological limitations on metering no longer force peak power prices
 to be averaged out and passed on to all consumers equally.
 In parallel, growing concerns over environmental damage from fossil-fired
 power stations has led to a desire to use large amounts of renewable energy.
 Dominant forms such as wind power and solar power are highly variable,
 and so the need for more sophisticated control systems became apparent,
 to facilitate the connection of sources to the otherwise highly controllable
 grid.
 Power from photovoltaic cells (and to a lesser extent wind turbines) has
 also, significantly, called into question the imperative for large, centralised
 power stations.
 The rapidly falling costs point to a major change from the centralised
 grid topology to one that is highly distributed, with power being both
 generated and consumed right at the limits of the grid.
 Finally, growing concern over terrorist attack in some countries has led
 to calls for a more robust energy grid that is less dependent on centralised
 power stations that were perceived to be potential attack targets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Domotics (Smart Homes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Home automation or Domotics is the use and control of home appliances remotely
 or automatically.
 Early home automation began with labour-saving machines like washing machines.
 Some home automation appliances are stand alone and do not communicate,
 such as a programmable light switch, while others are part of the internet
 of things and are networked for remote control and data transfer.
 Hardware devices can include sensors (like cameras and thermometers), controlle
rs, actuators (to do things), and communication systems.
 Remote control can range from a simple remote control to a smartphone with
 Bluetooth, to a computer on the other side of the world connected by internet.
 Home automation systems are available which consist of a suite of products
 designed to work together.
 These typically connected through Wi-Fi or power line communication to
 a hub which is then accessed with a software application.
 Popular applications include thermostats, security systems, blinds, lighting,
 and door locks.
 Popular suites of products include 
\emph on
X10
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Z-Wave
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
Zigbee 
\emph default
all of which are incompatible with each other.
 Home automation is the domestic application of building automation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Smart Cities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A smart city is a urban development vision to integrate multiple information
 and communication technology (ICT) solutions in a secure fashion to manage
 a city’s assets,e.g.
 local departments information systems, schools, libraries, transportation
 systems, hospitals, power plants, law enforcement, and other community
 services.
 The goal of building a smart city is to improve quality of life by using
 technology to improve the efficiency of services and meet residents’ needs.
 ICT allows city officials to interact directly with the community and the
 city infrastructure and to tell what is happening in the city, how the
 city is evolving, and how to enable a better quality of life.
 Through the use of real-time systems and sensors, data are collected from
 citizens and objects - then processed in real-time.
 The information and knowledge gathered are keys to tackling inefficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services,
 to reduce costs and resource consumption and to improve contact between
 citizens and government.
 Smart city applications are developed with the goal of improving the management
 of urban flows and allowing for real time responses to challenges.
 A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than
 one with a simple 'transactional' relationship with its citizens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other terms that have been used for similar concepts include cyberville,
 digital city, electronic communities, flexicity, information city, intelligent
 city, knowledge-based city, MESH city, telecity, teletopia, Ubiquitous
 city, wired city
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sectors that have been developing smart city technology include government
 services, transport and traffic management, energy, health care, water,
 innovative urban agriculture and waste management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Major technological, economic and environmental changes have generated interest
 in smart cities, including climate change, economic restructuring, the
 move to online retail and entertainment, ageing populations, and pressures
 on public finances.
 The European Union (EU) has devoted constant efforts to devising a strategy
 for achieving 'smart' urban growth for its metropolitan city-regions.The
 EU has developed a range of programmes under ‘Europe’s Digital Agenda

\begin_layout Subsection
Smart Cars (Vehicular Automation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vehicular automation involves the use of mechatronics, artificial intelligence,
 and multi-agent system to assist a vehicle's operator.
 These features and the vehicles employing them may be labelled as intelligent
 or smart.
 A vehicle using automation for difficult tasks, especially navigation,
 may be referred to as semi-autonomous.
 A vehicle relying solely on automation is consequently referred to as robotic
 or autonomous.
 After the invention of the integrated circuit, the sophistication of automation
 technology increased.
 Manufacturers and researchers subsequently added a variety of automated
 functions to automobiles and other vehicles.
\end_layout

 - to tie up all activities relating to 'intelligent' automobiles.
 The term covers all vehicles that are equipped with modern information
 and communication technologies (ICT) to increase road safety and/or the
 flow of traffic, or to reduce the environmental impact of road transport.
 A well-established and widely known 'intelligent' device would be the anti-lock
 braking system ABS, which prevents the wheels from locking while braking
 and thus enables the driver keeping the car under control.
 An example for a more recent system would be the electronic brake assistance
 which helps the driver brake effectively, or even brakes the car on its
 own if a collision is imminent and there is no driver reaction at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Small-scale IOT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the initiatives and projects mentioned in the previous paragraph are
 high-sounding declarations and, of course, we expect them to be working
 in some years; but, what about those numerous devices that surround us
 in our everyday life that we hardly know how to control? Who knows how
 to set and use the many features of a washing machine or an electric oven?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is particularly true for programmable devices that we program the first
 time we install them and - what is very common - if for some reason its
 settings are lost, we have to reprogram it and, most likely, we won't be
 able to find the user's guide that came with it.
 At best, we will find the booklet an reschedule the widget.Otherwise and,
 if we are fortunate, we will be able to find in Internet some information
 that will permit us to reset the device or even a pdf of the user's guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this is just the beginning.
 Can anybody still remember the time and efforts required to schedule a
 chronothermostat, for instance?.
